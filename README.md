# Freeside Branding

> The Freeside logos and other branding material.

This repository contains the Freeside logos and other branding material. The PNG is the original, as designed by @shinsters in Adobe Fireworks (a Freeside Alumni). The SVG is a (modified) trace done in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

We also have a poster in the `Poster` directory. The `Materials/` directory contains a flyer, another poster, and a template slide deck for presentations.
